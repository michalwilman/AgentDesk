## 🔧 Implementation Details

### Changes Made to Each Page

For each page (`pricing`, `about`, `support`), the following changes were made:

1. **Import Statement Added**:
```tsx
import HomeChatWidget from '@/components/home/HomeChatWidget'
```

2. **Widget Rendered Before Closing `</main>`**:
```tsx
      </footer>

      {/* Chat Widget */}
      <HomeChatWidget />
    </main>
  )
}
```

### Placement
The chatbot widget is placed:
- After the footer
- Before the closing `</main>` tag
- This ensures it appears on every page consistently in the same position

## 🎯 User Experience

### Consistent Behavior Across All Pages

Visitors will now see the **same chatbot** on every page:

1. **Homepage** → Chat about AgentDesk, trial, features
2. **Features** → Explain specific features, guide to trial
3. **Pricing** → Answer pricing questions, guide to registration
4. **About** → Share company info, guide to trial
5. **Support** → Provide help, answer questions

### Chat Persistence

- ✅ **Conversation persists** across page navigation
- ✅ Uses **localStorage** with key `agentdesk_home_chat_history_en`
- ✅ If user navigates from `/pricing` to `/about`, their conversation continues
- ✅ Chat remains open/closed based on user's last state

### State Management
